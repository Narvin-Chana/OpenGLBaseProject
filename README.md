# OpenGLBaseProject
Base project using OpenGL (GLEW)

Contains a few small tests for rendering sprites, 3d objects and implementing camera movement etc.. using a custom-made OpenGL abstraction layer.

Current tests : 
* Clear Color: shows the screen with a customizable color using ImGUI.
* Texture 2D: shows moveable logos on screen using textures.
* Cube 3D: shows a 3D cube, contains camera controls to move and look around the world.
